Design goals for the U2 virtual machine:

U2 bytecode should map naturally and efficiently to assembly. U2 bytecode should also be relatively trivial to write an interpreter for.

Registers : 16
r1-r16

Instruction Width: 4 bytes (unsigned int)
31......26 25..22 21...18 17...14 13..........0
[ opcode ] [ rd ] [ rs1 ] [ rs2 ] [ immediate ]
opcodes: 64
