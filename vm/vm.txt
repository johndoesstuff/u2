Design goals for the U2 virtual machine:

U2 bytecode should map naturally and efficiently to assembly. U2 bytecode should also be relatively trivial to write an interpreter for.

Registers : 16
r1-r16

Each instruction is read as a 4-byte (32 bit) chunk of data.

Instruction Width: 4 bytes (unsigned int)
31......26 25..22 21...18 17...14 13..........0
[ opcode ] [ rd ] [ rs1 ] [ rs2 ] [ immediate ]
This allows for 64 opcodes, 16 registers, 14 bit immediates without extension (max signed 8191), and a maximum of 3 registers per instruction.

For instructions using an immediate the value of rs2 allows you to extend the bytes of immediate storage.
- 0 indicates no immediate extension (use regular 14 bits)
- 1 indicates extra instruction (4-bytes) for immediate storage (disregard value in 14 bits)
- 2 indicates extra instruction (8-bytes) for immediate storage (disregard value in 14 bits)
